Test documentation is a test of arifacts created before and during the testing of the software with the purpose to estimate the effort, 
test the coverage of test we are about to perform, tracking the resource we need for testing and tracking the execution progress.
Consists of test planning, test design and test execution. 
There are 8 examples we have in test documentation:
1. Test policy - high level document which describer methods, principles and testing goals of the organisation.
2. Test strategy - a high level document which identifies the test levels to be executed for the project.
3. Test plan - a complete planning document which contains the scope, approach, resources and schedule.
4. Requirements traceability matrix - a document which connects the requirements to the test cases.
5. Test scenarios -  an item or an event of a software system which could be verified by one or more test cases.
6. Test case -  group of input values, execution, preconditions and results that are developed from test scenarios.
7. Test data - exists before the test is executed and using test data, the test cases are executed.
8. Defects report - documented report of any flaw in software system


### Advantages:
 - to either reduce or remove any uncertainties about the testing activities
 - acts as training material to freshers in the software testing process
 - good marketing & sales strategy to showcase Test Documentation to exhibit a mature testing process
 - offer a quality product to the client within specific time limits
 - helps you to improve transparency with the client

 ### Disadvantages:
 - cost of the documentation may surpass its value
 - it is time consuming
 - could be written by someone who does not know the material well
 - it canget tiring to keep the track of the changes made
 - poor documentation directly reflects the quality of the product 

 ## TEST SCENARIOS

 steps on how to write it:
 1. Read the Requirement Documents
 2. figure out possible users actions and objectives
 3. After reading the Requirements Document and doing your due Analysis, list out different test scenarios that verify each feature of the software
 4. Traceability matrix
 5. Reviewing
